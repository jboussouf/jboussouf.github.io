The project in which this dataset is utilized is a hackathon project organized by the prestigious i2a club. Participants in this hackathon aim to leverage the provided dataset to develop innovative solutions and gain insights into the housing market trends in Seattle, Washington, USA. With a substantial number of houses sold in this region, the dataset offers a robust and diverse set of data points to facilitate comprehensive analysis and model building. By combining their skills and creativity, the participants hope to contribute to the advancement of real estate analytics and contribute meaningful solutions for both buyers and sellers in the dynamic Seattle housing market.
