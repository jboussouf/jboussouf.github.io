title: "Confidential, secure and optimal communication: Secure P2P chat application using java"
excerpt: "In this work, we will propose a secure P2P chat application in java programming language, and this system consists of a robust, fully decentralized (P2P) and end-to-end encrypted network architecture.<br/><img src='/images/communication_P2P.png'>"

The need to transmit messages between us human beings requires a strong need for security due to the existence of sensitive data; this always leads us to find more confidential means of communication when messages are transmitted from a sender to a receiver. In other words, it is a matter of avoiding the survival of messages by bailout attacks.

Today we find enough applications that perform this task, but as far as the idea of peer to peer is concerned, we don't find enough, because its network architecture presents complications to ensure real security since there is no controlled organization that manages the transmission of messages. At this stage, we have worked in this project to develop a secure chat application that includes more powerful encryption and coding methods, we are talking about RSA, AES... .<br/><img src='/images/communication_P2P.png'>
