This work focuses on advancing the detection of diabetic retinopathy through the implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) models, a state-of-the-art deep learning approach to computer vision. The system automates the identification of levels of diabetic retinopathy by classifying retinal images into three categories. The ViT model is meticulously trained on a large dataset of retinal images from Kaggle (available at <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanneo/diabetic-retinopathy-resized-arranged">amanneo/diabetic-retinopathy-resized-arranged</a>).
